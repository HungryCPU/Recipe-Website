<h4>How to Make Fish Tacos</h4>

<p>I came up with this Baja-style fish taco recipe after eating fish tacos from a street vendor 
    in Ensenada, Mexico. The salsa can be made a day in advance for flavors to blend.

<h4>How to Make Fish Tacos Step-By-Step</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Make the salsa: Mix tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeños, 1 tablespoon jalapeño juice, and garlic salt together in a bowl until well combined. Pour lime juice over top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    <li>Make the tacos: Toss coleslaw mix and ranch dressing together in a bowl; set aside until needed.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Stir beer and batter mix together in a bowl. Dip cod into batter mix.</li>
    <li>Fry cod in batches in the hot oil until cooked through and coating is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer cod with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    <li>Wrap corn tortillas in wet paper towels. Microwave on high until warm, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>For each serving, stack two tortillas on a plate; top with cod, Mexican cheese, coleslaw mixture, and salsa. Squeeze a lime wedge over top and drizzle with Sriracha.</li>
